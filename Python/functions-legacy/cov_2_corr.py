def cov2corr(cov):
    # Convert covariance matrices to correlation matrices.
    #
    # USAGE:
    #  [SIGMA,CORREL] = cov2corr(COV)
    #
    # INPUTS:
    #   COV   - A K by K covariance matrix -OR-
    #           A K by K by T array of covariance matrices
    #
    # OUTPUTS:
    #   SIGMA  - A K by 1 vector of standard deviations if COV is K by K -OR-
    #            A T by K matrix of standard deviations
    #   CORREL - A K by K matrix of correlations -OR-
    #            A K by K by T matrix of correlations.
    #
    # EXAMPLES:
    #   # DCC(1,1)
    #   [~,~,Ht] = dcc(data,[],1,0,1)
    #   [S,Rt] = cov2corr(Rt);
